    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>
      Stock&Co is a Shopify app that enables syncing of inventory levels (product quantities) across
      multiple stores. It addresses a major inconvenience because there is no full support for i18n
      in Shopify and users need to create separate stores for each language they require. At the
      moment the app is a prototype, it is used primarily internally but there is intent to release
      it in beta after a complete re-write with Vue3 and Fastify.

    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>
      In early 2018 a decision was made to externalize order fulfillment for
      <a

      stores to a 3rd party warehouse and, consequently, this required Stock&co to integrate with
      the 3rd party systems. Also, with a growing team in Bento&Co, there was a need to unify
      product creation in all the Bento&Co stores.

    <h2>Contribution</h2>
    <p>
      I worked back-end side to create the product and inventory levels sync between the 3rd party
      systems, Stock&co and Shopify. The main challenges for this task were a tight deadline and an
      insufficient integration between the 3rd party system and Shopify. Basically, Stock&co had to
      act as an in-between Shopify and the 3rd party system. Tasks included:
    </p>
    <ul class="content-list">
      <li>
        Restructure the Stock&Co MongoDB database to save the relevant order data required by the
        3rd party
      </li>
      <li>
        Restructure and enhance merging of product data by SKU inside Stock&co
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a REST API with endpoints to fetch product data and inventory levels from Stock&co
        and push inventory updates to Stock&co and subsequently to Shopify
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up user validation and authorization through transactional emails
      </li>
      <li>
        Basic support for Shopify multi-locations
      </li>
      <li>UI enhancements - e.g. a multi-select tag-cloud</li>
      <li>
        Post Covid19 pandemic the partnership with the 3rd party ended and I was in charge of
        refocusing Stock&co to its core- inventory level sync. I also completely rewrote the unified
        product creation feature, relying on Shopify web-hooks for syncing product data across
        multiple Shopify stores instead of having a custom product creation flow.
      </li>
    </ul>
